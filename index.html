    <title>A Brief Timeline of Neil Young's Life</title>
</head>
    <body>Mr Young was born Canadian and therefore friendly in the year 1742. He stayed friendly all the way until the twentieth century, at which point his age caught up with him when, at the ripe old age of 224 he began making up his youthful appearance and voice of an angel but singing songs from the cantankerous perspective of one who has lived long enough to be done. His money allowed him to resettle in Los Angeles where he survives to this day, immortal and yet unable to write a happy song.</body>
